# Image Classification Model Performance Improvement

This project involves four tasks that aim to improve the performance of an image classification deep learning model. The tasks cover various aspects such as model implementation, training, evaluation, optimization, and regularization techniques. The goal is to enhance the model's performance and compare different configurations to identify the most effective approach for image classification tasks.

## Task 1: Model Implementation and Training
In this task, the first step is to implement the image classification model described in the Collab Notebook provided. The implementation includes setting up the necessary layers, defining the architecture, and configuring the model for training. Once the model is implemented, it is trained on a given dataset of images. The performance of the model is evaluated using loss and metric plots for both training and validation data. Additionally, an analysis of correctly and incorrectly labeled images is conducted to gain insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Task 2: Optimizer and Learning Rate Configuration
The second task focuses on testing the model with two additional optimizers and different learning rates. By experimenting with different optimizer configurations and learning rates, the goal is to identify the optimal combination that improves the model's performance in image classification tasks. The performance metrics, such as loss and accuracy, are compared across different configurations to determine the most effective setup.

## Task 3: Impact of Batch Size on Training Time
In the third task, the impact of varying batch sizes on training time is investigated. The Early Stopping callback technique is employed to monitor the model's performance during training and automatically stop training when it no longer improves. By analyzing the training time for different batch sizes, insights can be gained regarding the trade-off between computational efficiency and model performance for image classification.

## Task 4: Regularization Techniques Comparison
The fourth task involves modifying the image classification model to include at least two regularization techniques. Regularization techniques such as dropout, L1 or L2 regularization, or batch normalization can be applied to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability. The modified model's performance is then compared and contrasted with the initial model configuration to evaluate the effectiveness of different regularization techniques in image classification tasks.

By completing these tasks, the assignment aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing image classification model performance. The results obtained from the different configurations and techniques can guide future model development and optimization efforts for image classification tasks.

Note: The Collab Notebook provided contains the necessary instructions, code templates, and datasets to complete the tasks specific to image classification.
